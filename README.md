# Robot-Dog
Experimental code for a robotic dog, which should be able to play recorded audio, remember room/building layouts, recognize faces or just recognize that there is a person in the vicinity, and possibly even accept voice commands.

This code may not be optimal or even fully-functional; it is primarily a learning process for myself. Depending on how practically I can implement the code, I will try to optimize it and add more functionality to the code (e.g. facial recognition rather than knowing that there is a person in front of the dog).
